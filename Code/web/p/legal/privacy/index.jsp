<b>Tree.st Privacy Policy &mdash; Revised January 30, 2013</b>

Tree.st, located at www.tree.st ("the Tree.st website"), is an online community platform created by Tree St., Inc. ("the Company"). We take the privacy of our communities and users very seriously as governed by this Privacy Policy (the "Policy"). The Company may amend this Policy at any time. Any such change will be effective immediately upon posting the modified Policy on this page, at www.tree.st/privacy

Your Community is defined by your organization's private online community inside the Tree.st platform. All members of your organization who join your Community are part of your Community only.

Only the members in your Community can view other Community member's profiles and discussions. Essentially, your Community is private and no Tree.st user who is not a member of your Community can view your Community member's profiles and discussions.

Community administrators (those members of your Community who have administrator access to your Community and its associated settings and member data) can impose additional security requirements for their Communities such as restricting membership to those members signing up for the Community with a specific e-mail domain (e.g. member@your-organization.com).

Community administrators own the User Content and member profile data created by their Community members. However, the Company reserves the right to share your private information with advertisers. This includes your email address, profile information, and discussion feeds as well as those of others in your Community. Community administrators can request that member profile data and discussion feeds posted to their Community be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes.

When you post Content (or engage in discussion feeds) in your Community on the Tree.st platform, all members of your Community will have access to that content. Tree.st keeps track of Content that you have uploaded to a Community on Tree.st as well as the top members for a Community. Such information, displayed with your Tree.st name and photo, if you uploaded one, is available to all members of your Community.

Because you may voluntarily disclose any Personal Data in your Community, you should be careful about the information you choose to disclose. Tree.st does not control that disclosure, and is not liable in any way for anyone's use or misuse of the information in the disclosure. In other words, use caution and judgment here.

Tree.st will send you administrative messages, and email updates regarding your account, your Communities, or the Tree.st platform. Tree.st may also send you notices of new Content that has been added to your Community in which you may be interested when you have subscribed to such notices. In some cases, Tree.st may also send you primarily promotional messages. In your account's preferences section, you can choose to opt out of promotional messages and new Content notices. You may opt out of receiving administrative messages by canceling your Tree.st account.

Tree.st uses cookie, IP address, and URL information to improve the content of the Tree.st platform, the quality of Tree.st servers, and to provide enhanced features to Community members, where available and as necessary. Tree.st uses cookies to save members' Tree.st login IDs, session validators, and on members' browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products and services to those members, as they become available. IP Addresses also help us to diagnose problems with Tree.st's servers, to administer the Tree.st platform, and to otherwise provide the Tree.st service to its users. IP addresses may be disclosed to a third party if Tree.st believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Tree.st, its members or the general public.

Tree.st may disclose Personal Data if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, where required by law, or, at Tree.st's sole discretion, where Tree.st deems necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of Tree.st's Terms of Service or the rights of Tree.st or any third party.

In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, Tree.st reserves the right to transfer all of Tree.st's member information in all Communities existing on the Tree.st platform at the time, including email addresses, to a separate entity. Tree.st will notify Community members (via a posting on this site or email (at Tree.st's discretion) of such a transfer, and members may choose to modify their registration information at that time. This means if you are concerned about your Personal Data migrating to a new owner, you can deactivate your account.

Tree.st uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. Although Tree.st makes good faith efforts to store the information collected by Tree.st and all Communities on the Tree.st Platform in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, Tree.st cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while Tree.st works hard to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, Tree.st cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.

Members may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information they have submitted to any Tree.st Community of which they are a member, by going to their account. Members may remove their information from Tree.st's live database by canceling their account. Even if you update or remove your information from Tree.st's live database, however, your Personal Data may be retained in Tree.st's backup files and archives. Members may remove their information from Tree.st by canceling their account.
