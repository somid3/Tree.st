Good morning,

We are a group of MIT graduate students who have created a new technology that can bring great value to your association.

Our tool allows your members to find exactly whom they're looking for within your association, via qualities that are specific to your association. In other associations this has helped increase membership, donations, and other factors.

We have a short video at http://www.tree.st -- We'd love to show you a quick demo today. Could we setup a time for that?

Thanks,
Socrates Rosenfeld
