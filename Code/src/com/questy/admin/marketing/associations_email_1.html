Good morning,

We are a group of MIT graduate students who have created a technology that can bring great value to your association.

Our tool allows your members to find exactly whom they're looking for within your association, via qualities that are specific to your association.

For example, in a community we built for an Army Veteran's association -- veterans can now discover others based on the their military expertise, Army unit, background, etc. This helped them increase their membership, donations, among other factors.

We have a 1 minute video at http://www.tree.st -- We'd love to show you a 10 minute demo, could we setup a time a demo?

Thanks,
Socrates Rosenfeld
Co-Founder Tree St., Inc.
