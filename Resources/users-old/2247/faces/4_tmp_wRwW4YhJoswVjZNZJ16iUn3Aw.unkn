Welcome to Athena
-----------------

- Project Athena was an eight-year experiment (1983-1991) to explore the use
  of computers in university educational programs.  The Project focused on
  developing computers as useful tools, rather than as objects of study, in
  the education of students at MIT.

- The Athena system, one of the fruits of Project Athena, is a campus-wide
  distributed computer service consisting of hundreds of networked
  workstations and related facilities (such as printers and file servers)
  available to MIT students and faculty to help them achieve their academic
  goals and learn about computers while at the Institute.

- For help about any aspect of Athena, visit the On-Line Help (OLH)
  web pages at: http://ist.mit.edu/services/athena/olh

  There you will find guides to all aspects of the supported Athena
  environment, including a basic introduction, a tutorial on using the
  command line (shell), information about the AFS file system and how
  to use it, and much more.

- If you run into problems, consult our extensive collection of
  answers in Hermes, the MIT Knowledge Base.  Visit http://kb.mit.edu
  for more information.

- If you require assistance, you can contact an Athena Consultant.
  The Athena Consulting office is open 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday
  (except MIT holidays).  You can reach a consultant by phone
  (x3-4435, 617-253-4435 from off campus) or e-mail (olc@mit.edu), or
  you can visit their office in building N42.

- If you're interested in the more technical aspects of Athena, visit
  the Debathena web page at http://debathena.mit.edu
  
  Debathena is the suite of packages and software that powers the
  Athena system, and much of the development was done by MIT students.
